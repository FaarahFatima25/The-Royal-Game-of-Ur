Here are the step-by-step instructions to play the Royal Game of Ur:

Objective: Be the first player to move all 7 of your tokens from your Home to your Goal.

Starting the Game:

Player O goes first. Players alternate turns.

Each player begins with 7 tokens in their Home (XXXXXXX for X, OOOOOOO for O).

On Your Turn:
a. Flip Coins: Press Enter to flip 4 coins. Each Head (H) allows moving a token 1 space. Tails (T) don't count.

Example: H-T-H-H means 3 moves.

b. Move a Token:

If you flipped 0 Heads, you lose your turn.

Choose to either:

Move a new token from Home (type 'home') if the starting space on your track is empty.

Move an existing token on the board (type the space label, like 'a' or 'g').

Movement Rules:

Tokens follow the path specific to your player (X or O track).

Only one token per space. You cannot land on your own tokens.

Knock Opponent: If you land on an opponent's token in the shared middle path (excluding the middle flower 'l'), their token is sent back to their Home.

Flower Spaces (h, t, d, r): Land here to get an extra turn. The middle flower (l) is safe but doesn't grant an extra turn.

Goal Entry: You must reach the Goal with an exact roll. Tokens in the Goal cannot be moved again.

Winning: The first player to move all 7 tokens into their Goal wins.

Tips:

Use flower spaces (h, t, d, r) to chain turns.

Block opponents by occupying shared path spaces.

Protect your tokens by moving them to the safe middle flower (l).

Commands During Play:

Enter 'home' to move a token from Home.

Enter a space label (e.g., 'b', 'k') to move a token.

Enter 'quit' to end the game.
